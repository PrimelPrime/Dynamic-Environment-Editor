# Dynamic Environment Editor Version 1.0 for MTA:SA
A tool to help you preview all modifiable settings inside your server for whatever use you desire.

This is an ongoing project that got its origin from https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/SetWorldProperty as I wanted to have a quick way of finding certain settings for my maps.
## Version 1.0
Added almost every modifiable function from https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Client_Scripting_Functions#World_functions
