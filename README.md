# Dynamic Environment Editor Version 1.0 for MTA:SA
A tool to help you preview most modifiable settings inside your server for whatever use you desire.

This is an ongoing project that got its origin from https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/SetWorldProperty as I wanted to have a quick way of finding certain settings for my maps.
# Changelog
